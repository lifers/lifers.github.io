Hello, my name is Nagata and I'm a student who is interested in becoming a software developer. This github page is a place to write down things that I want to share with the world. It could be something that I'm currently working on, things that I wanted to understand better by explaining it or just random thoughts.

If you want to get in touch, send a mail to **nagata (dot) parama (at) gmail (dot) com**.
